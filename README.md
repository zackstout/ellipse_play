# Planet Visualization
Finally we have two main ingredients: drawing the boundaries of the sectors with `ellipse.js` and making the ellipse move with the proper velocity (`ell_eq_test.js`). Just need to be able to fill in the area to demonstrate Kepler's second law. It's a shame we couldn't get programmatic gravity working...

- Implementing algorithm to make ellipse move with proper speed (faster when near planetary focus, slower when away from it):
